Bootstrap is a blessing and a curse. Here... let me explain.

Bootstrap, I've come to discover, is a very simple and effective method of styling a website, albeit somewhat generic. At first, it looked like it took away a lot of style options from the developer, which was actually good for me. Trying to understand the concepts lead me to focus more on substance than style right now. Which is a good thing. Understand what you're doing and how you're doing it first, then make it pretty.

As it turns out, utilizing Bootstrap, while adding in CSS is super effective. It gives you the freedom to make a modern, versatile website frame, that scales properly with little to no effort. And the addition of CSS allows your creative side to run wild. Seriously, go nuts.

That aforementioned was the blessing. Now, the curse.

At the end of Free Code Camp's Basic Front End, you're tasked with completing two builds/projects. The first, a Tribute page for whomever or whatever you'd like, you design it from scratch in <a href="https://www.codepen.io" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. This is the one I'll focus on for the remainder of the post.

Create a tribute page from scratch.... Sound like fun, right?

OMGWTFBBQ...

Trying to keep all of the CSS selectors, properties, inherited styling, straight - while adding Bootstrap modifications... Kill me.

I was so frustrated with my first attempt at the Tribute page, I scrapped it. <strong>Seriously</strong>. After 2 days of working on it, I scrapped it completely. I didn't even feel bad. I decided that while cementing the foundation, I needed to take my eyes off of the creative aspect. I decided to recreate the example page (without looking at the code). Their example page looked fairly plain and simple, yet effective and clean. So, I got to work.

After a few frustrating days (seriously, days), I was finished with my page. It wasn't a perfect recreation and there were still a few things that had me stymied, but I haven't had a overwhelming sense of completion like that since college. Ahhh...
