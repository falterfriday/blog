When I left Seattle, I decided to leave my career as well. Sales is great and there's a lot of opportunity and excitement there. But if your goals don't include sales management, burn-out will find you.

It took me a few years to figure that out - roughly 2. I stayed for 10.

When I relocated to DC, I was in a situation where I could hunt down another job that was in my wheelhouse, or I could get out of it all together and take another path.

This decision didn't come easily as you would think. The money that you make in sales, even straight out of high school, is nothing to sneer at. It paid for my college education, several large expenses, and I was never "in a bad way" with money. But that's the problem.

Frame of dollars,in the form of heart

I enjoyed the compensation, not the job.

The more I dwelt on that fact, the more I realized that I just wasn't happy with where it was taking me.



So, I left.
