Ugh... Boostrap made me want to punch a baby in the face. Sometimes... Right in its face.

The second project was designing a portfolio on CodePen. While the experience was much better than the struggles of my first page (Tribute), the navbar was a huge headache. I was trying to make sure that, in addition to working, it was mobile friendly. I'm getting the feeling that anything designed for the web these days needs to be mobile friendly, if-not mobile first.

I. Was. Frustrated.

For some reason, when switching from medium container to x-small, the menu bar would be in the right place, but be completely non-functional. Everything was in place. The proper libraries were present. The 2-3 tutorials I looked at looked like I had it down 100%. It was at this point that I started banging my head against my desk, when suddenly it just started to work.

Now I'm pissed.

I have no idea why it wasn't working before, but it was working now. Success!

NEXT!!

I have nothing to contribute to a portfolio page aside from another page that I designed, on the same site, from an example. Yeah... not the best portfolio page. Looking back on it now, it's a hot bag of crap. But I'm fairly new to this, so I'm not worried. Stock pictures place holders for the win!
