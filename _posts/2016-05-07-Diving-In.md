To catch you up: I've done my research and I've decided to jump back into coding using Free Code Camp.

Free Code Camp is a site very much like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">CodeCademy</a> with the exception that they have additional challenges and DIY projects. Also, they're continuously updating and adding addition content too. Seriously, I've noticed additional items and challenges in the 3 weeks I've been using it. As an added bonus, once you've completed certain sections, you can help out non-profits, gaining actual experience. Which will get you out of the "I need experience to get a job to gain experience" loop.

The signup was pretty simple. You can create a new profile with an email or with your GitHub account. Going through the setup process, they have you link your GitHub account anyway, so skip the extra steps and just use your GitHub account to start. Don't have a GitHub account yet? Go here to set one up.

Once I got logged in and whet through the setup and tutorials, I started on the "Front End Development" track. Which started with HTML.
