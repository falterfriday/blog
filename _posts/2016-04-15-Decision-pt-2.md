Let me catch you up:

I've moved to DC from Seattle
I've left my job in sales
I have no idea what I'm going to do
Well, now that you're caught up, let me fill you in on what I've decided to do with my life:

Nothing.

For now at least.

I decided to take a few weeks to get the trip out of my system (Seattle â‡’ DC, in March... yuck) and get the apartment set up. At this point, I'm pretty sure of the direction I want to go. A solid week of driving gives you an absurd amount of time to think.
