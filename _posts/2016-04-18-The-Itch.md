This is an addendum to Flashback. It was originally included, but due to the gravity of the event, I had to separate it to flesh it out.<hr>

A year ago, I had dinner with a few friends. There were only 4-5 people but only one stands out in my mind from that evening. Here's why:

She was fairly new to the group - a new neighbor of one of my friends. We were all having dinner over at my place and we started talking. She was in the tech industry, a SEO firm (no idea what that was at the time). She told me she had heard about me through so-and-so, knew what I did. In fact, we worked less than a block from each other.

But that wasn't the most surprising thing. She said she was surprised by me, that I wasn't as "techie" as she thought I would be, with  a disappointed tone.

"Techie"?

I had no idea, so I asked. She replied that I wasn't all that into tech. I like the gadgets and messing around with stuff, but I didn't know how any of it worked. No coding or software development expereince...

I merely nodded at this and said I was sorry to disappoint. She talked about HTML, scripting, PPC, AdSense, etc... I really had no idea. And the conversation faded into the night.

Looking back on that conversation, I realize that whoever talked me up to her must have filled her with excitement that there was someone in the group who she could talk geek with. True geek. Everybody else was in academia.

Now, for some odd reason, that conversation echoed through my head for weeks. Something was missing now. I realized that it had been missing for a while, but it had been forgotten with time. She had shone a light on the empty space. Now that I knew it was missing...

It itched.



This is what I dwelled upon during the hours and hours behind the wheel across the US.
