Web development and I have circled each other for a long time. Here's the story.

===  1999 (good god I'm old):===
Back in high scool I designed a laughably basic site for a history class, complete with moving flag element. Flash, maybe? No idea...

But, alas, I didn't stick with it. I decided to go to aim for a degree in chemical engineering, noting too tech related.

That first year of college, my time was spent not going to class, playing with MySpace (ah... memories), and trying to get with one of my best friends from high school. Note the lack of time spent on studies? Yeah, I didn't last long. But that's the beginning of a completely different set of stories. For now, we're focusing on the more relatable past.

===  Summer 2010:
The summer before I left for Seattle, I was asked to help fix a friend's website. It was a basic page with images, profile links, and links to a customized payment portal - fairly simple stuff. I put it off for the entire summer. Once I fent the deadline closing in,  I closed myself off for a few days to wrap my head around what I had bitten off. Let me say that without Dreamweaver, and a good understanding of how file systems work, I would have been screwed.

I completed the site updates the day before I left my midwest life for Seattle - good times.

===  Early 2014:
A coworker of mine left to spend a few months in San Francisco for a "code bootcamp" - whatever that was. I had no idea.

So, as I said before, web development and I go back a ways.
