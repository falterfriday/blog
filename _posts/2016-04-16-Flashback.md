Web development and I have circled each other for a long time. Here's our backstory.

High School:

Back in high scool I designed a laughably basic site for a history class, complete with moving flag element. Flash, maybe? No idea...

But, alas, I didn't stick with it. I decided to go for a degree in chemical engineering, noting too tech related.

That first year of college, my time was spent not going to class, playing with MySpace (ah... memories), and trying to get with one of my best friends from high school. Note the lack of time spent on studies? Yeah, I didn't last long. But that's the beginning of a completely different set of stories. For now, we're focusing on the more relatable past.

Summer 2010:

The summer before I left for Seattle, I was asked to help fix a friend's website. It was a basic page with profiles, images, and links to a customized scheduling/payment portal - fairly simple stuff. I put it off for the entire summer. Once I felt the pressure of the deadline closing in,  I closed myself off for a few days to wrap my head around what I had bitten off. Let me say that without Dreamweaver, and a good understanding of how file systems work, I would have been screwed.

I completed the site updates the day before I left my midwest life for Seattle - good times. Once I got to Seattle, I was super stressed with finding a job. I didn't have time to focus on budding skills. I needed to use the skills I had already developed. Coding would wait again.

Early 2014:

A coworker of mine left to spend a few months in San Francisco for a "code bootcamp" - whatever that was. I had no idea, but I was intrigued. This guy had a pretty decent job and was giving it up to <strong>pay</strong> for a program that would train him to do something else. I did a little digging and discovered CodeCademy, The Odin Project, etc...

I initially signed up for CodeCademy. After going through their HTML/CSS tutorials, I was thoroughly bored. There were no projects to work on. Nothing to really test your skills and comprehension. Now, this was back in 2014. They've added a lot of content since then, but I still hear that there's a lot more hand-holding than other sites.

In my frustrations with CodeCademy, I jumped over to The Odin Project. It went well, but after a while I noticed that they were using CodeCademy tutorials... So that was a bust. I quit for a little bit at that point. Life started throwing hurdles up left and right, and spending 1-3 hours a night on this was untenable.

So, now you know where I'm coming from when I say that web development and I have been circling each other for years.
