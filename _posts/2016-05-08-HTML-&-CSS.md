HTML and I go way back - CSS and I, not so much.

From the various courses and websites that I've gone through, I've become familiar with HTML. Going back over it through FCC seemed tedious, but I knew that if I wasn't careful and didn't take notes, I would begin to slack off. So, I stayed the course. To know thine enemy is to know thyself.

All-in-all the HTML section was meager. It covered your basic elements and structures. Then, it quickly segued into CSS. At first, I was a little confuse due to the lack of HTML content, but once I got into the CSS I began to understand

It became clear after a few exercises that you could create a fairly standard or generic HTML framework. Then CSS the crap out of it.

As it turns out, I loves me some CSS. However, this is also the part where the lines begin to blur a bit.

Keeping the commands from CSS straight started to become more and more difficult as the tutorials went on. CSS has its own massive library of properties (literally hundreds) that allow you to select and modify any and all HTML elements.

Once my head was leaking CSS selectors, I decided to take a break. It was a lot to take in all at once and hindsight being what it is, I should have paced myself and reviewed as needed. This eventually came back to haunt me.
