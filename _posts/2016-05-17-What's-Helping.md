Once I finished up with the Portfolio project, I realized in a very real way that I'm enjoying this. I'm frustrated, confused, and more overwhelmed  than I care to admit to myself - but I'm enjoying it. Sitting in front of my screen looking at a problem knowing that there is a solution, pounding my head in to the desk, then finding it on my own has been wildly rewarding.

There are a few weeks until the start of the bootcamp, so I've been taking some time to try to immerse myself in the culture - listening to podcasts, reading books, etc...  So I'm going to take a few moment to talk about a few things I've picked up.

I came across a Medium article that recommended a few podcasts to check out if you were new to coding. In an effort to take sound advice, I did. The first up was <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org" target="_blank">CodeNewbie</a>.

I've been floored by it. The host, Saron, does an amazing job at bringing in guests who's industry tenure varies and having them talk about their experiences, how they got there, and words of encouragement for people who are just getting their feet wet. I started listening to the first podcast to see how it developed and I'm finding that even the old episodes, 2yrs+, have helpful insights, tips, and links (some are dead though).

I also picked up a fairly new podcast as well - <a href="http://www.frontendhappyhour.com" target="_blank">Front End Happy Hour</a>. There's a lot of shop talk that goes over my head as a newbie, but it gives me hope. The hosts and guests all talk about what they're doing and where the industry is going, new trends, etc... But the best thing I take away from this particular podcast is the attitude. They all sound like they really enjoy what they do. If you remember from an earlier post, the exact opposite is what caused me to abandon my last career. So I have hope.

Since I finished the Portfolio project, I've moved on to learn JavaScript with the Free Code Camp track. Just like the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap tutorials, the JavaScript tutorials are pretty straightforward but the challenges are devastating. I've found myself reading through more Mozilla Developer Network references than I care to ever admit. But I found a site that really helps keep all of that in line - overapi.com. It's a cheat sheet with a ton of useful links for various languages.

Helpful Links:

Up Next: I've just started playing around with JavaScript, so the next post is going to delve into that a little bit. See you next time!
