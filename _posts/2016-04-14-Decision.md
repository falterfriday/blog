When I left Seattle, I needed to make a decision regarding my career.Sales is great and there's a lot of opportunity and excitement there, but if your goals don't include sales management, burn-out will find you.

It took me a few years to figure that out - roughly 2. I stayed for 10.

When I relocated to DC, I was in a situation where I could hunt down another job that was in my wheelhouse, or I could take a completely different path.

This decision didn't come easily as you would think. The money that you make in sales, even straight out of high school, is nothing to sneer at. It paid for my lifestyle, college education, several large expenses, and pretty much everything else for the past decade. 

That. That right there. That's the problem.

I enjoyed the compensation, not the job. 

The more I dwelt on that fact, the more I realized that I just wasn't happy with where it was taking me.



So, I left.
